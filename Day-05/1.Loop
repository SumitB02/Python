Day 5.1 Average Height Exercise

Average Height

Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculaytes the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g students_heights = [18.124,165,173,189,169,146]
The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g. 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 146 = 1146

There are a total of 7 heights in students_heights

1146 / 7 = 163.71428571428572

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

Example Input 

156 178 165 171 187

In this case, student heights would be a list that looks like : [156,178,165,171,187]

Example Output

171

Important : You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer.
            You should try to replicate their functions using what you have learnt about for loops.
